# Transaction Processing in ANSI SQL (2) - Summary

---

## 1. Transaction Basics
- **Definition**: A sequence of SQL operations treated as a single unit with ACID properties.
- **Commands**: `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`.

---

## 2. Transaction Phenomena
- **Dirty Read**: Reading uncommitted data.
- **Non-Repeatable Read**: Data changes between reads.
- **Phantom Read**: New rows appear in result sets.

---

## 3. Isolation Levels
- **Read Uncommitted**: Allows all phenomena.
- **Read Committed**: Prevents dirty reads.
- **Repeatable Read**: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads.
- **Serializable**: Prevents all phenomena, highest isolation.

---

## 4. Practical Implications
- Isolation levels impact concurrency and performance; choose based on application needs.

## Practice Exercises Summary
1. **Dirty Read Practice**: Simulate reading uncommitted data.
2. **Non-Repeatable Read Practice**: Observe data changes within a transaction.
3. **Phantom Read Practice**: Detect new rows in result sets.
4. **Serializable Practice**: Test highest isolation with locking.
5. **Comparison Practice**: Compare behaviors across isolation levels.
