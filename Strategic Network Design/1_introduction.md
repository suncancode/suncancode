INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC NETWORK DESIGN

1. What is Network Design?
- Definition: Network design involves PLANNINNG and IMPLEMENTING a computer network TO MEET organizaion's specific needs (including selecting technologies, devices and network structure).
- Strategic aspect: 
    + Aligns network design with long-term organizational goals.
    -> Ensuring efficient use of resources over time 

2. Network Design Methodology
A methodology is a set of methods and principles used to design a network. 2 common approaches:
    (1) Top-Down Approach:
        - Starts with business requirements and goals, then designs the network to meet them.
        - Simplifies the design process and ensures alignment with organizational needs.
    (2) Bottom-Up Approach:
        - Begins with selecting network topologies and technologies.
        - Riskier, as it may not meet user or organizational requirements, leading to potential design failures.
        
3. Design Models
    (1) Hierarchical Model:
        -  Devide the network into layers:
            + Core Layer: High-speed backbone with hig-end routers/switches, low latency, and fault tolerance.
            + Distribution Layer: Aggregates network traffic.
            + Acess Layer: Provides user access to network services.
        - Advantages: Easy to understand, scale, and troubleshoot due to dictinct layer functionalities.
    (2) PPDIOO Model:
        - 6 Phases:
            + Prepare
            + Plan
            + Design
            + Implement
            + Operate
            + Optimize
        - Iterative process for continuous network improvement.

    (3) Eight-Step Design Methodology:
        - Step 1: Identify customer requirements (applications, services, goals, constrains).
        - Step 2: Describe the existing network (infrastructure, devices, protocols).
        - Step 3: Design network topology using Top-Down approach.
        - Step 4: Plan network implementation with a timeline.
        - Step 5: Construct a prototype network with detailed documentation.
        - Step 6: Document the design (Introduction, Requirements, Infrastructure, Design, Proof of Concept, Implementation Plan, Appendices).
        - Step 7: Implement the network design.
        - Step 8: Verify, monitor, and modify the network as needed.

4. Network Analysis
    - Purpose:
        + Provides a comprehensive understanding of network complexity.
        + Creates an audit trail to justify design decisions from technical, budgetary, schedule, and resource perspectives.
    - Architecture:
        + Involves selecting technologies, defining relationships between network functions, and mapping applications/devices to the network.
        + Results in a reference architecture describing traffic flows.

5. Key Takeaways
    - Strategic networrk design aligns technical solutions with organizational goals.
    - The Hierarchical, PPDIOO, and Eight-Step models provide structured approaches to network design.
